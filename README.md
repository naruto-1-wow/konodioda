    I'm a student in China.I just entered college this summer and what I major in is software engineering.So I am a freshman from head to toe.In order to have a good future,I have to study harder and harder.Oneday,I heard about the github by chance.Knowing that it could offer some help on my study,I signed up for it at once.I wish I could make great progresses by making good use of this web.
    That's all,thanks.
